# ConjoinedMinecraft
*Ever want to play as conjoined twins with a friend in minecraft? No? Here's a plugin anyways. Idea from Dream, as usual.*  

**NOTE:** Only 2 players can play with this plugin at once. I mean, technically you can play with more than 2, but only 2 players can be conjoined at once, which is the whole point of this plugin.  

With this plugin, two players will be conjoined. One player will be the onlye one able to control movement, while the other player is the only one able to interact with the world.  

**/movement (playerName)** to Assign a player to control movement.  
**/interact (playerName)** to assign a player to control interactions.  
**/conjoin** to start the conjoined minecraft experience once a player has been assigned to both roles.
